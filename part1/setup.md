Setting up a basic playground for chef
--------------------------------------
So, you've decided to take the plunge, great.

First thing first is we need to get your environment set up. I chose virtualbox and vagrant as my playground and I'll walk you through it here.

virtualbox
----------
Go ahead and go [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Download) and download the relevant virtual box binary for your base OS.  It should be straight forward install, the last pkg for my OSX install was basically Next-next-next-install.  Entered my root password and there we go.

Attempt to start it virtualbox is if comes up asking to create a virtual machine, if so go ahead to the next section.

Next I strongly suggest downloading something called iTerm2 if you are on OSX.  Click [here](http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/downloads) and grab the lastest stable version.

NOTE: you don't have to use this, you can use terminal but iTerm2 is just better in general, trust me.
