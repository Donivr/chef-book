chef-book 
=========
(Read this first)

The Pre-reqs you need before reading this book
----------------------------------------------
The first and formost is that I'm writing this for Linux based OSes. I understand chef can can run on Windows and MacOS, but that's not what I want to focus on. 
So please if these commands don't make sense to you, you should probably look for another book before reading this one.

- `grep`
- `cd` `ls` `cat` 
- `vim` OR `emacs` OR `nano`
- `bash` OR `zsh`

I'm looking to aim this at a Junior Level Linux Sysadmin, or a Intermediate Level Linux Sysadmin that needs a primer on chef.

You should be able to get in and out of the editor that you choose. You should have a realitivly confortable with the command line in general.
Like most technology howto books, I want to get to the meat of the system as quickly as possible. I'm appolgizing ahead of time if you are confused; most if not all should be fixed via a [google](http://lmgtfy.com/) search pretty easily.
I am writing this to me "open-source" so if there is a place that should be fleshed out better, don't hesiated to put a comment in or hell, make a PR and flesh it out yourself!

The situations you might be in that brought you to read/look for this book
