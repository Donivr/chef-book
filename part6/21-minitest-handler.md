# minitest-handler-cookbook

Ok, so we are running `test-kitchen` writing some tests, we are solid right? Great! But you had a conversation with one of your Devs about something called "minitest" or "rspec" and it's peaked your interest. This section will be going over a _different_ way of using testing that I originally learned before `test-kitchen` and `bats`.
They both have their strong suits, both have there weaknesses. My plan is just to open your eyes to this and you choose the path you want to take.
