# serverspec

[serverspec](http://serverspec.org/) is probably one of the tools that I'll keep a hold of for the rest of my career. I actually wrote a [blog](http://jjasghar.github.io/blog/2013/07/12/serverspec-the-new-best-way-to-learn-and-audit-your-infrastructure/) post about it. I'm going to distill it down here as a primer so if you want you can use it.
