# Open Source vs Hosted Chef Server

If you've made it this far, you're either extremely determined to learn as much as you can about chef or you think you need to use chef server.  I'd like to start by saying (again) that 75-85% of use cases can be resolved with just chef-solo. chef server adds a level of overhead that unless you have a use case for it, really isn't that useful. (You have been warned...again.)

I'm going to spend this section talking about the two _main_ types of chef servers you can run.  I'll run through the requirements of each, how to set them up, and then the next section we'll attach our chef-book vm to each of them. NOTE: you can only have a machine check in with ONE chef server, so I'll start with Open Source chef, then remove it and have it check in with Hosted chef.

During the rest of the book, if I reference talking to a chef server, it should be interchangeable, if not, I'll make note of it and explain which way they differ.
