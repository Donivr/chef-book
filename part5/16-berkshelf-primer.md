# Berkshelf

[Berkshelf](http://berkshelf.com/) has become the defacto standard for dealing with dependancies with cookbooks. To quote from the site:
> If youâ€™re familiar with Bundler, then Berkshelf is a breeze.

A great example is straight from the main site:
## Install
```bash
root@chef-book:~# gem install berkshelf
1 gem installed
root@chef-book:~#
```

Next, let's create a `Berksfile`. Go to a your base cookbook and type `berks init .` you should see something like this:
```bash
root@chef-book:~/core# berks init .
By default, this cookbook was generated to support bundler, however, bundler is not installed.
To skip support for bundler, use --no-bundler
To install bundler: gem install bundler
      create  Berksfile
      create  Thorfile
      create  .gitignore
         run  git init from "."
      create  Gemfile
      create  Vagrantfile
Successfully initialized
```
Go ahead and add the following to your `Berksfile`:
```ruby
site :opscode

cookbook 'mysql'
cookbook 'nginx', '~> 0.101.5'
```
Then run `berks install` to grab the depenancies:
```bash
root@chef-book:~/cookbooks# cd base/
root@chef-book:~/cookbooks/base# berks install
Installing mysql (3.0.12) from site: 'http://cookbooks.opscode.com/api/v1/cookbooks'
Installing nginx (0.101.6) from site: 'http://cookbooks.opscode.com/api/v1/cookbooks'
Installing openssl (1.1.0) from site: 'http://cookbooks.opscode.com/api/v1/cookbooks'
Installing build-essential (1.4.2) from site: 'http://cookbooks.opscode.com/api/v1/cookbooks'
Installing runit (1.3.0) from site: 'http://cookbooks.opscode.com/api/v1/cookbooks'
Installing yum (2.4.0) from site: 'http://cookbooks.opscode.com/api/v1/cookbooks'
Installing bluepill (2.3.0) from site: 'http://cookbooks.opscode.com/api/v1/cookbooks'
Installing rsyslog (1.9.0) from site: 'http://cookbooks.opscode.com/api/v1/cookbooks'
Installing ohai (1.0.2) from site: 'http://cookbooks.opscode.com/api/v1/cookbooks'
root@chef-book:~/cookbooks/base#
```
Nice! Go ahead and upload it if neeed, add it to your `run_list` and run `chef-solo` or `chef-client` you should get mysql and nginx installed.

## knife-solo

Remember that [knife-solo](../part3/09-knife-plugins.md#knife-solo) thing? I mentioned the _cookbooks_ directory. This is the temp location that berks dumps the cookboks you want to push up. Keep this in mind as you start to play with it.

With knife-solo you can add the above to the `Berksfile` that was created, and it'll automatically install what you are looking for, something like this:
```bash
[~/do]% vim nodes/162.244.68.215.json
```
```json
{"run_list":["recipe[nginx::default]","recipe[mysql::default]"]}
```
Then:
```bash
[~/do] % knife solo cook root@162.243.68.215

There's a ton more to Berkshelf, but as you can see it can make file a lot easier.  But like `apt-get` or `yum` it'll install it as the defaults from the cookbook maintainers. You'll still need to go in and configure it locally. Hint: maybe a recipe in a "company" cookbook that overwrites the defaults?
